## 📖 Introduction
This README provides a step-by-step guide for the first practice in Cloud Computing using AWS. In this practice, we will cover three parts to help you get started with AWS services and configurations.

## 🚀 Prerequisite
Before you begin, make sure you have the following:
- An AWS account (you can sign up at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/))
- AWS CLI installed and configured with your AWS credentials

## 🌟 Practice Overview
The first practice is divided into three parts:

### 🚀 Part 1: Launching EC2 Instance
In this part, we will launch an EC2 instance and open two ports: 80 for HTTP and 22 for SSH. We will then verify that we can access the instance and that the HTTP page is accessible.

### 🚧 Part 2: Extending the Setup
Building upon Part 1, we will create two instances. The first instance will have SSH access from external sources (port 22), and the second instance will only allow SSH access from the first instance. Additionally, the second instance will also host the HTTP service, requiring ports 80 and 22 to be open.

### 🚢 Part 3: Deploying Moodle
Continuing from Part 2, we will make Moodle available within the setup.
