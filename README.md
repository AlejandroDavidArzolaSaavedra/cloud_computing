# ☁️ AWS Cloud Computing Practice Repository

Welcome to the AWS Cloud Computing Practice Repository! Here, you will embark on a journey to learn cloud computing with AWS through a series of 5 hands-on practices.

## 🚀 Practice 1: Basic Deployment
The goal of this practice is to provide you with your first hands-on experience with AWS services. You will apply the knowledge gained in the theoretical class by using the EC2 service to prepare and deploy instances in the cloud. Additionally, you will explore CloudFormation to launch EC2 instances.

## 🌐 Practice 2: Database, Load Balancing, and Scaling
In this practice, you will delve into tools for load balancing and scaling to ensure your applications are highly available and can handle increased traffic.

## 📜 Practice 3: CloudFormation
The objective of this practice is to learn how to define AWS cloud architectures in text using CloudFormation templates.

## 🐳 Practice 4: Containers
In this practice, you will learn to use containers on AWS through services like Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS).

## 🔄 Practice 5: Decoupling
The objective of this practice is to experiment with AWS queuing and event services to decouple a monolithic application into a set of scalable microservices. For the basic part of this practice, you will prepare a simple application in your preferred programming language. This application should consist of at least 3 functions (fA, fB, fC), with the second function dependent on the first, and the third dependent on the second. Each function should have a minimum execution time.

# 🌟Conclusion

As you progress through these practices, you will gain hands-on experience with AWS services and architectures, helping you become proficient in cloud computing with AWS. Feel free to explore each practice folder for detailed instructions and resources.
